C# Basic Drills

I did the below exercises for The Tech Academy and composed them into four projects, each project designated with a subset of the numbers. So for example, OneTwoFour means I completed exercises 1, 2 and 4 in that project. 

Exercises
1) The difference between overloading methods and overriding methods, showing each in operation.
2) Creation of a derived class
3) Each of these access modifers: Public, protected, internal, private, protected internal. 
4) Creation of a sealed class
5) Use of an interface
6) Use of a try/catch/finally block
7) Handling an exception by writing the important data from the exception to a log file on the local machine. 
8)  Value types vs. reference types
9) Use of the keyword 'this'.
10) Serialization of an object, in this case a BLOB (binbary large object). The object should be streamed to a text file. Show also the retrieval of the object form that file and conversion back to it's original form.
11) Differences between an abstract class and an interface, in terms of creation and use of each. 
12) Creation and use of a delegate
13) Creation and use of a multi-cast delegate
14) Creation of a struct
15) Creation and use of nullable types
16) Creation and use of an enumerable
